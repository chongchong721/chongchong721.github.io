Hi, my name is Yuan Meng. I'm interested in graphics, especially in rendering & materials. I earned my undergraduate degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. However, I did not get in touch with graphics until I was doing my master's degree at Carnegie Mellon. That being said, I'm still new to this field and there is still a lot to learn.

About Myself: 
-  I like playing video games, that's why I always wondering how every thing works for a game to display its amazing content on a display. Some of my favorites are: Baldur's Gate 3, Mass Effect trilogy, Outer Wilds and Assassin's Creed II trilogy. However, they are not those with the best graphics(Games like Callisto Protocol have amazing graphics but the games themselves are meh)
-  I enjoy rock/metal music. Progressive rock and doom metal are my favorite. Among Chinese singers/songwriters/bands, 罗大佑(Lo Ta-yu) is my favorite.
-  I also enjoy snowboarding. Here is a picture when I hiked up 7's Heaven at Whistler Blackcomb in British Columbia.
