Hi, my name is Yuan Meng. I'm interested in graphics, especially in rendering & materials. I earned my undergraduate degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. However, I did not get in touch with graphics until I was doing my master's degree at Carnegie Mellon. That being said, I'm still new to this field and there is still a lot to learn.



You can find my [CV](/assets/docs/cv.pdf) here.



About Myself: I like playing video games, that's why I always wondering how every thing works for a game to display its amazing content on a display. I also enjoy snowboarding. Here is a image when I hiked up 7's Heaven at Whistler Blackcomb in British Columbia.
