# MCMC Reflectometry
## Introduction
This project is my master's thesis. It discovers the possibility of acquiring real life material's BRDF adaptively, using Markov chain Monte Carlo. The idea is that a good Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm will importance sample any function. In terms of BRDF, it will importance sample the real life BRDF and provide me with good samples to use in rendering real-life material.
